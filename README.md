# Craftbeerpi4 Kettle Logic Plugin

## PID Logic with boil threshold.

If the target Temperature is above a configurable threshold the PID will be ignored and heater is switched on to the max output value. This is helpful if you use the same kettle for mashing and boiling.

Once the boil threshold temperature is reached, the boil will be done with the max boil output power


### Installation:

Please have a look at the [Craftbeerpi4 Documentation](https://openbrewing.gitbook.io/craftbeerpi4_support/readme/plugin-installation)

- Package name: cbpi4-PIDBoil
- Package link: https://github.com/PiBrewing/cbpi4-pidboil/archive/main.zip


### Parameters

![PIDBoil Settings](https://github.com/avollkopf/cbpi4-PIDBoil/blob/main/cbpi4-PIDBoil-logic.png?raw=true)

- P - proportional value
- I - integral value
- D - derivative value
- SampleTime - 2 or 5 seconds -> how often the logic calculates the power setting
- max output - heater power which is set above boil threshold
- Boil Threshold - Above this temperature and if Target temperature is set over Threshold the heater will be set to Max Boil Output Power (default: 98°C / 208F) else PID is used
- Max Boil Output - Power (%) that is used above Boil Threshold Temperature (default: 100%)
- PID_DuringBoil - When the boil threshold is active: No (default): fixed at Max_Boil_Output / Yes: handed to the PID controller
